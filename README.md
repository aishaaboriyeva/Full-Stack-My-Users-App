# Welcome to My Users App
***

## Task
Create a rudimentary MVC model 
The final product is a webapp that manages a database of users, and implements sessions and cookies for authetication.

## Description
I have used Ruby, Sinatra, and SQL to accomplish the MVC architecture.
My_user_model contains a class that has methods to interact with the SQL database file.
The app.rb controller uses sinatra to route requests and send results to the ERB renderer.

This build is set up and tested for http://localhost:8080.
